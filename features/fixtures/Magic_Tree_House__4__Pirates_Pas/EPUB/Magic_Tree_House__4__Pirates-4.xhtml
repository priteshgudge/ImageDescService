      <p id="p_000189" class="indent">"Oh man, I forgot the book!" he said. He dropped his socks and boots below the tree house.</p>
      <p id="p_000190" class="indent">"Come on, Jack!" Annie shouted.</p>
      <p id="p_000191" class="indent">"I'll be right back!" Jack called. "I've got to get the book!"</p>
