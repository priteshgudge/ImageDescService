      <p id="p_000480" class="nonindent">Annie found her voice first. "The M person," she whispered.</p>
      <p id="p_000481" class="indent">"Yes. I'm the M person," said Morgan.</p>
      <p id="p_000482" class="indent">"Wh-where are you from?" asked Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000483" class="indent">"Have you ever heard of King Arthur?" said Morgan.</p>
      <p id="p_000484" class="indent">Jack nodded.</p>
      <p id="p_000485" class="indent">"Well, I am King Arthur's sister," said Morgan.</p>
      <p id="p_000486" class="indent">"You're from Camelot," said Jack. "I've read about Camelot."</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="60" id="p60" />
      <p id="p_000487" class="indent">"What did you read about me, Jack?" said Morgan.</p>
      <p id="p_000488" class="indent">"You--you're a witch."</p>
      <p id="p_000489" class="indent">
        <span id="span_000067" class="text">Morgan smiled. "You can't believe</span>
        <em id="em_000043">everything</em>
        <span id="span_000068" class="text">you read, Jack."</span>
      </p>
      <p id="p_000490" class="indent">"But are you a magician?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000491" class="indent">"Most call me an enchantress. But I'm also a librarian," said Morgan.</p>
      <p id="p_000492" class="indent">"A librarian?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000493" class="indent">"Yes. And I've come to the 20th century, your time, to collect books. You are lucky to be born in a time with so many books."</p>
      <p id="p_000494" class="indent">"For the Camelot library?" asked Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000495" class="indent">"Precisely," said Morgan. "I travel in this tree house to collect words from many different places around the world. And from many different time periods."</p>
      <p id="p_000496" class="indent">"Did you find books here?" said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000497" class="indent">"Oh yes. Many wonderful books. I want to</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="61" id="p61" />
      <p id="p_000498">borrow them for our scribes to copy."</p>
      <p id="p_000499" class="indent">"Did you put all the bookmarks in them?" said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000500" class="indent">"Yes. You see, I like the pictures in the books. Sometimes I want to visit the scenes in the pictures. So all the bookmarks mark places I wish to go."</p>
      <p id="p_000501" class="indent">"How do you get there?" asked Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000502" class="indent">"I placed a spell on the tree house," said Morgan. "So when I point to a picture and make the wish, the tree house takes me there."</p>
      <p id="p_000503" class="indent">"I think you dropped this in dinosaur times," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000504" class="indent">He handed the gold medallion to Morgan.</p>
      <p id="p_000505" class="indent">"Oh, thank you! I wondered where I'd lost it," she said. She put the medallion into a hidden pocket in her cape.</p>
      <p id="p_000506" class="indent">"So can anybody work the spell?" asked</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="62" id="p62" />
      <p id="p_000507">Annie. "Anybody who tries it?"</p>
      <p id="p_000508" class="indent">"Oh dear, no! Not just anybody," Morgan said. "You two are the only ones besides me to do it. No one else has ever even seen my tree house before."</p>
      <p id="p_000509" class="indent">"Is it invisible?" asked Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000510" class="indent">"Yes," said Morgan. "I had no idea it would ever be discovered. But then you two came along. Somehow you hooked right into my magic."</p>
      <p id="p_000511" class="indent">"H-how?" asked Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000512" class="indent">"Well, for two reasons, I think," explained Morgan. "First, Annie believes in magic. So she actually saw the tree house. And her belief helped you to see it, Jack."</p>
      <p id="p_000513" class="indent">"Oh man," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000514" class="indent">"Then you picked up a book, Jack. And because you love books so much, you caused my magic spell to work."</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="63" id="p63" />
      <p id="p_000515" class="indent">"Wow," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000516" class="indent">"You can't imagine my dismay when you started to take off for dinosaur times. I had to make a very quick decision. And I decided to come along."</p>
      <p id="p_000517" class="indent">"Oh, so you were the pteranodon!" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000518" class="indent">Morgan smiled.</p>
      <p id="p_000519" class="indent">"And the cat and the knight and Polly!" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000520" class="indent">"Yes," said Morgan softly.</p>
      <p id="p_000521" class="indent">"You were all these things to help us?" asked Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000522" class="indent">"Yes, but I must go home now. The people in Camelot need my help."</p>
      <p id="p_000523" class="indent">"You're leaving?" whispered Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000524" class="indent">"I'm afraid I must," said Morgan.</p>
      <p id="p_000525" class="indent">She picked up Jack's backpack and handed it to him. Jack and Annie picked up their raincoats.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="64" id="p64" />
      <p id="p_000526">It had stopped raining.</p>
      <p id="p_000527" class="indent">"You won't forget us, will you?" asked Annie, as they put their raincoats on.</p>
      <p id="p_000528" class="indent">"Never," said Morgan. She smiled at both of them. "You remind me too much of myself. You love the impossible, Annie. And you love knowledge, Jack. What better combination is there?"</p>
      <p id="p_000529" class="indent">Morgan le Fay touched Annie's forehead gently. And then Jack's. She smiled.</p>
      <p id="p_000530" class="indent">"Good-bye," she said.</p>
      <p id="p_000531" class="indent">"Good-bye," said Annie and Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000532" class="indent">Annie left the tree house first. Jack followed. They climbed down the rope ladder for the last time.</p>
      <p id="p_000533" class="indent">They stood below the oak tree and looked up.</p>
      <p id="p_000534" class="indent">Morgan was looking out the window. Her long white hair blew in the breeze.</p>
      <p id="p_000535" class="indent">Suddenly the wind began to blow.</p>

      <p id="p_000537" class="indent">The leaves began to shake.</p>
      <p id="p_000538" class="indent">A loud whistling sound filled the air.</p>
      <p id="p_000539" class="indent">Jack covered his ears and squeezed his eyes shut.</p>
      <p id="p_000540" class="indent">Then everything was silent.</p>
      <p id="p_000541" class="indent">Absolutely silent.</p>
      <p id="p_000542" class="indent">Jack opened his eyes.</p>
      <p id="p_000543" class="indent">The tree house was gone.</p>
      <p id="p_000544" class="indent">All gone.</p>
      <p id="p_000545" class="indent">Absolutely gone.</p>
      <p id="p_000546" class="indent">Annie and Jack stood a moment, staring up at the empty oak tree. Listening to the silence.</p>
      <p id="p_000547" class="indent">Annie sighed. "Let's go," she said softly.</p>
      <p id="p_000548" class="indent">Jack just nodded. He felt too sad to speak. As they started walking, he put his hands into his pockets.</p>
      <p id="p_000549" class="indent">He felt something.</p>
      <p id="p_000550" class="indent">Jack pulled out the gold medallion. "Look!"</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="67" id="p67" />
      <p id="p_000551">he said. "How did--?"</p>
      <p id="p_000552" class="indent">Annie smiled. "Morgan must have put it there," she said.</p>
      <p id="p_000553" class="indent">"But how?"</p>
      <p id="p_000554" class="indent">"Magic," said Annie. "I think it means she'll be coming back."</p>
      <p id="p_000555" class="indent">Jack smiled. He clutched the medallion as he and Annie took off through the wet, sunny woods.</p>
      <p id="p_000556" class="indent">As they walked, the sun shined through the woods. And all the wet leaves sparkled.</p>
      <p id="p_000557" class="indent">Everything, in fact, was shining.</p>
      <p id="p_000558" class="indent">Leaves, branches, puddles, bushes, grass, vines, wild flowers--all glittered like jewels.</p>
      <p id="p_000559" class="indent">Or gleamed like gold.</p>
      <p id="p_000560" class="indent">Annie had been right, thought Jack.</p>
