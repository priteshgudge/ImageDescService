      <p id="p_000122" class="nonindent">Jack felt hot sunlight streaming into the tree house.</p>
      <p id="p_000123" class="indent">He smelled saltwater.</p>
      <p id="p_000124" class="indent">He heard the sound of waves.</p>
      <p id="p_000125" class="indent">He and Annie looked out the window.</p>
      <p id="p_000126" class="indent">The tree house was in a palm tree. Beyond was a bright blue sea. A tall sailing ship was on the horizon. It was just like the picture in the book.</p>
      <p id="p_000127" class="indent">"Too late!" squawked Polly.</p>
      <p id="p_000128" class="indent">"Look!" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000129" class="indent">Polly was flying in circles above the tree</p>

      <p id="p_000131" class="indent">"Come on, let's follow her! Let's go in the water!" said Annie. She took off her raincoat and dropped it on the floor.</p>
      <p id="p_000132" class="indent">"Wait, we have to study the book first," said Jack. He started to reach for the book. But Annie grabbed it.</p>
      <p id="p_000133" class="indent">"You can read it on the beach," she said. Without even looking at the cover, she shoved the book into Jack's backpack.</p>
      <p id="p_000134" class="indent">

      </p>
      <p id="p_000135" class="indent">"Okay," Jack said. He took off his raincoat, too.</p>
      <p id="p_000136" class="indent">"Come on!" Annie handed Jack his backpack, then started down the ladder.</p>
      <p id="p_000137" class="indent">Jack folded the raincoat and put it next to the stack of books. He put on his backpack. Then he went down the ladder.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="13" id="p13" />
      <p id="p_000138" class="indent">As soon as Annie hit the sand, she ran toward the ocean. Jack watched her wade into the water. She was still wearing her rain boots.</p>
      <p id="p_000139" class="indent">"Your boots, Annie," called Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000140" class="indent">She shrugged. "They'll dry out," she said.</p>
      <p id="p_000141" class="indent">Jack took off his boots and socks. He put them beside his pack. Then he rolled up his jeans. And ran across the hot sand into the waves.</p>
      <p id="p_000142" class="indent">The water was warm and clear. Jack could see shells and tiny fishes.</p>
      <p id="p_000143" class="indent">He shielded his eyes against the sun. And peered out at the sea.</p>
      <p id="p_000144" class="indent">The tall sailing ship seemed a bit closer.</p>
      <p id="p_000145" class="indent">"Where's Polly?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000146" class="indent">Jack glanced around. No sign of Polly. Not in the palm trees. Not on the sunlit sand. Not over the bright blue sea.</p>

      <p id="p_000148" class="indent">When Jack looked out at the sea again, the ship seemed even closer. Now Jack could see its flag.</p>
      <p id="p_000149" class="indent">As he stared at the ship's flag, a chill went through him.</p>

      <p id="p_000151" class="indent">"Oh man," he breathed. He started out of the water.</p>
      <p id="p_000152" class="indent">"What's wrong?" said Annie. She splashed after him.</p>
      <p id="p_000153" class="indent">Jack ran to his backpack. Annie followed.</p>
      <p id="p_000154" class="indent">He grabbed the book from his backpack. He looked at the cover. For the first time, he and Annie read the title of the book.</p>
      <p id="p_000155" class="indent">"Yikes!" said Annie.</p>
