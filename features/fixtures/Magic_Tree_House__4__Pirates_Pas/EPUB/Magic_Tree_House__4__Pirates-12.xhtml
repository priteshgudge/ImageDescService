      <p id="p_000566" class="nonindent">"Let's look again, Jack," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000567" class="indent">Jack and Annie were walking home from the library. The path went right by the Frog Creek woods.</p>
      <p id="p_000568" class="indent">Jack sighed. "We looked this morning," he said. "We looked the day before. And the day before that."</p>
      <p id="p_000569" class="indent">"Then you don't have to come," said Annie. "I'll go look by myself."</p>
      <p id="p_000570" class="indent">She took off into the woods.</p>
      <p id="p_000571" class="indent">"Annie, wait!" Jack called. "It's almost</p>

      <p id="p_000572">dark! We have to get home!"</p>
      <p id="p_000573" class="indent">But Annie had disappeared among the trees.</p>
      <p id="p_000574" class="indent">Jack stared at the woods. He was starting to lose hope. Maybe he would never see Morgan again.</p>
      <p id="p_000575" class="indent">Weeks had passed. And there had not been one sign of Morgan le Fay. Nor had there been one sign of her magic tree house.</p>

      <p id="p_000578" class="indent">"Hurry!" called Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000579" class="indent">"She better not be kidding," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000580" class="indent">He took off into the woods to find Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000581" class="indent">Night was falling fast. Crickets chirped</p>

      <p id="p_000582">loudly. It was hard to see through the shadows.</p>
      <p id="p_000583" class="indent">"Annie!" Jack shouted.</p>
      <p id="p_000584" class="indent">"Here!" she called.</p>

      <p id="p_000587" class="indent">Annie's voice came from above.</p>
      <p id="p_000588" class="indent">Jack looked up.</p>
      <p id="p_000589" class="indent">"Oh man," he breathed.</p>
      <p id="p_000590" class="indent">Annie waved from the window of a tree house. It was in the tallest oak in the woods. A long rope ladder hung down from it.</p>
      <p id="p_000591" class="indent">
        <em id="em_000050">The magic tree house was back</em>

      <p id="p_000592" class="indent">"Come on up!" Annie shouted.</p>
      <p id="p_000593" class="indent">Jack ran to the rope ladder. He started climbing.</p>
      <p id="p_000594" class="indent">He climbed and climbed and climbed.</p>

      <p id="p_000596" class="indent">As he climbed, he looked out over the woods. High above the treetops it was still light.</p>
      <p id="p_000597" class="indent">At last, Jack pulled himself into the tree house.</p>
      <p id="p_000598" class="indent">Annie sat in the shadows. Books were scattered everywhere.</p>
      <p id="p_000599" class="indent">On the floor the letter M glowed in the dim light. The M stood for Morgan le Fay.</p>
      <p id="p_000600" class="indent">But there was no sign of Morgan herself.</p>
      <p id="p_000601" class="indent">"I wonder where Morgan is," said Jack.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="8" id="pagenum_000006" />
      <p id="p_000602" class="indent">"Maybe she went to the library to get some more books," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000603" class="indent">"We were just at the library. We would have seen her," said Jack. "Besides, the library's closed now."</p>
      <p id="p_000604" class="indent">
        <em id="em_000051">Squeak!</em>
      </p>
      <p id="p_000605" class="indent">A little mouse ran out from behind a stack of books. It ran to the M shining in the floor.</p>
      <p id="p_000606" class="indent">"Yikes," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000607" class="indent">The mouse sat on the middle of the M. It looked up at Jack and Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000608" class="indent">"Oh, it's so cute," Annie said.</p>
      <p id="p_000609" class="indent">Jack had to admit the mouse was cute. It had brown-and-white fur and big dark eyes.</p>
      <p id="p_000610" class="indent">Annie slowly reached out her hand. The mouse didn't move. Annie patted its tiny head.</p>
      <p id="p_000611" class="indent">"Hi, Peanut," she said. "Can I call you Peanut?"</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="9" id="pagenum_000007" />
      <p id="p_000612" class="indent">"Oh brother," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000613" class="indent">"Do you know where Morgan is?" Annie asked the mouse.</p>
      <p id="p_000614" class="indent">
        <em id="em_000052">Squeak.</em>
      </p>
      <p id="p_000615" class="indent">"You're nuts, Annie," said Jack. "Just because the mouse is in the tree house doesn't mean it's magic. It's a plain old mouse that crawled in, that's all."</p>
      <p id="p_000616" class="indent">Jack looked around again. He saw a piece of paper on the floor.</p>
      <p id="p_000617" class="indent">"What's that?" he said.</p>
      <p id="p_000618" class="indent">"What's what?" asked Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000619" class="indent">Jack went over and picked up the paper. There was writing on it.</p>
      <p id="p_000620" class="indent">"Oh man," whispered Jack, after he read the words.</p>
      <p id="p_000621" class="indent">"What is it?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000622" class="indent">"A note," said Jack. "It must be from Morgan. I think she's in big trouble!"</p>
