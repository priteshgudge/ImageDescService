      <p id="p_000344" class="nonindent">"So the treasure must be under that rock," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000345" class="indent">"Right," said Jack. "Now we just have to get back to the island. We'll show Cap'n Bones where the treasure is. Then while all the pirates are digging, we'll sneak up to the tree house."</p>
      <p id="p_000346" class="indent">"And make a wish to go home," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000347" class="indent">"Right." Jack poked his head out of the round window of the cabin. "Cap'n Bones, sir!" he shouted.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="42" id="p42" />
      <p id="p_000348" class="indent">The pirates took up the cry. "Cap'n Bones! Cap'n Bones!"</p>
      <p id="p_000349" class="indent">"Hey?" came a horrible voice.</p>
      <p id="p_000350" class="indent">Cap'n Bones stuck his ugly face through the window. His good eye glared at Jack. "What do you want, lubbers?"</p>
      <p id="p_000351" class="indent">"We're ready to tell the truth, sir," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000352" class="indent">"Go ahead," growled Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000353" class="indent">"We know where Captain Kidd's treasure is."</p>
      <p id="p_000354" class="indent">"Where?"</p>
      <p id="p_000355" class="indent">
        <span id="span_000063" class="text">"We can't just tell you. We have to</span>

        <span id="span_000064" class="text">you," said Annie.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="p_000356" class="indent">Cap'n Bones gave Annie and Jack a long hard look.</p>
      <p id="p_000357" class="indent">"You'll need a rope," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000358" class="indent">"And shovels," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000359" class="indent">Cap'n Bones growled. Then he roared at</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="43" id="p43" />
      <p id="p_000360">his men, "Get some rope and shovels!"</p>
      <p id="p_000361" class="indent">"Aye, aye, Cap'n!"</p>
      <p id="p_000362" class="indent">"Then throw these lubbers in the boat! We're going back to the island!"</p>
      <p id="p_000363" class="indent">"Aye, aye, Cap'n!"</p>
      <p id="p_000364" class="indent">Back in the rowboat, Jack saw the sky had grown even darker with clouds. The waves were bigger. The wind was howling.</p>
      <p id="p_000365" class="indent">"Gale's a-blowin'!" said Pinky.</p>
      <p id="p_000366" class="indent">"You'll see a gale if I don't get me gold today, by thunder!" Cap'n Bones shouted. "Row, dogs, row!"</p>
      <p id="p_000367" class="indent">The three pirates battled the waves, until the rowboat reached the island. They all piled onto the shore.</p>
      <p id="p_000368" class="indent">Cap'n Bones grabbed Jack and Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000369" class="indent">"Okay, lubbers," he said. "Now show us where the treasure is."</p>
      <p id="p_000370" class="indent">"There," said Annie. She pointed at the</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="44" id="p44" />
      <p id="p_000371">black rock near the tip of the island.</p>
      <p id="p_000372" class="indent">"Under that rock," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000373" class="indent">Cap'n Bones dragged Jack and Annie down the beach to the black rock.</p>
      <p id="p_000374" class="indent">"Get to work!" Cap'n Bones said to Pinky and Stinky.</p>
      <p id="p_000375" class="indent">"What about you?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000376" class="indent">"Me? Work?" Cap'n Bones chuckled.</p>
      <p id="p_000377" class="indent">Jack gulped. How could they get away from him?</p>
      <p id="p_000378" class="indent">"Don't you think you should help your friends?" he said.</p>
      <p id="p_000379" class="indent">Cap'n Bones gave Jack a horrible grin. "Nay. I'm going to hold you two--till there's treasure in me hands!"</p>
