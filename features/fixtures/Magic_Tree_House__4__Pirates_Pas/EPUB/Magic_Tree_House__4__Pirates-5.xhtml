      <p id="p_000204" class="nonindent">Jack started to run across the hot sand. He ran as fast as he could.</p>
      <p id="p_000205" class="indent">But the pirates ran faster.</p>
      <p id="p_000206" class="indent">Before Jack knew it, the biggest pirate had grabbed him!</p>
      <p id="p_000207" class="indent">Jack struggled. But the pirate had huge, strong arms. He held on to Jack and laughed a mean, ugly laugh. He had a shaggy black beard. A patch covered one eye.</p>
      <p id="p_000208" class="indent">Jack heard Annie yelling. He saw her coming down the rope ladder.</p>
      <p id="p_000209" class="indent">"Stay where you are!" Jack shouted.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="22" id="p22" />
      <p id="p_000210" class="indent">But Annie kept coming. "Leave him alone, you bully!" she cried.</p>
      <p id="p_000211" class="indent">The other two pirates laughed meanly. They were dirty and ragged.</p>
      <p id="p_000212" class="indent">Annie charged up to the biggest pirate. "Let him go!" she said. She hit the pirate with her fist and kicked him.</p>
      <p id="p_000213" class="indent">But the pirate just growled. Then he grabbed her, too. And with his giant hands, he held Jack and Annie as if they were two kittens.</p>

      <p id="p_000215" class="indent">"Let go!" Annie shouted into his face.</p>
      <p id="p_000216" class="indent">But Cap'n Bones just smiled. All his teeth were black.</p>
      <p id="p_000217" class="indent">Annie fell silent.</p>
      <p id="p_000218" class="indent">Cap'n Bones laughed loudly. Then he turned to the other two.</p>

      <p id="p_000220" class="indent">"Find out what's in their house, you dogs," he said.</p>
      <p id="p_000221" class="indent">"Aye, aye, Cap'n!" they answered. And they started up the ladder to the tree house.</p>
      <p id="p_000222" class="indent">"What do you spy, Pinky?" shouted Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000223" class="indent">"Books, Cap'n!" Pinky shouted down.</p>
      <p id="p_000224" class="indent">"Aghh, books," growled Cap'n Bones. He spit on the sand. "I want gold, you dogs!"</p>
      <p id="p_000225" class="indent">"Dogs are nicer than you," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000226" class="indent">"Shhh," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000227" class="indent">"What about you, Stinky?" Cap'n Bones roared.</p>
      <p id="p_000228" class="indent">"Just books, Cap'n!" shouted Stinky.</p>
      <p id="p_000229" class="indent">"Aghh, books," said Cap'n Bones. He spit on the sand again. "I hate books! Keep looking, dogs! Find me something good!"</p>
      <p id="p_000230" class="indent">Cap'n Bones grabbed Jack's backpack.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="25" id="p25" />
      <p id="p_000231">"What's in here?" he said.</p>
      <p id="p_000232" class="indent">"Nothing--" Jack quickly opened the pack. "Just paper, a pencil, a book."</p>
      <p id="p_000233" class="indent">"Another book!" roared Cap'n Bones. "That's vile booty!"</p>
      <p id="p_000234" class="indent">A gleeful shriek pierced the air.</p>
      <p id="p_000235" class="indent">Cap'n Bones froze. "What's that?" he shouted.</p>
      <p id="p_000236" class="indent">"Look, Cap'n! Look!"</p>
      <p id="p_000237" class="indent">Pinky leaned out the tree house window. He held the medallion. It glimmered in the sunlight.</p>
      <p id="p_000238" class="indent">Oh brother, thought Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000239" class="indent">"Throw it down!" cried Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000240" class="indent">"It's not yours!" shouted Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000241" class="indent">Cap'n Bones dropped Jack and Annie. He caught the medallion as it fell.</p>
      <p id="p_000242" class="indent">"Gold! Gold! Gold!" he cried. Cap'n Bones</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="26" id="p26" />
      <p id="p_000243">threw back his head and laughed horribly.</p>
      <p id="p_000244" class="indent">He grabbed two of his pistols. He shot them into the air. Pinky and Stinky howled like wolves.</p>
