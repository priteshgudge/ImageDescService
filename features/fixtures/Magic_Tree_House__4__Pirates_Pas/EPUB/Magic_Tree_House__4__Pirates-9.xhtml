      <p id="p_000381" class="indent">The wind howled. The two pirates pulled. And pulled. And pulled.</p>
      <p id="p_000382" class="indent">"They need help!" said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000383" class="indent">"Aghh, let the dogs do the work!" growled Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000384" class="indent">"You're not very nice to them," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000385" class="indent">"Who cares?" roared Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000386" class="indent">"Cap'n! We got it!" shouted Pinky.</p>

      </div>
      <p id="p_000388" class="indent">They started pulling the rock across the sand.</p>
      <p id="p_000389" class="indent">"Now let's dig where the rock was," said Jack. "All of us!"</p>
      <p id="p_000390" class="indent">But Cap'n Bones ignored his suggestion.</p>
      <p id="p_000391" class="indent">"Dig, you dogs!" he shouted.</p>
      <p id="p_000392" class="indent">Pinky and Stinky started to dig. The wind blew even harder. There was going to be a thunderstorm.</p>
      <p id="p_000393" class="indent">"Oww! I got sand in me eyes!" Pinky whined.</p>
      <p id="p_000394" class="indent">"Oww! Me back hurts!" Stinky cried.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="47" id="p47" />
      <p id="p_000395" class="indent">"Dig!" shouted Cap'n Bones. He held Jack and Annie with one hand. With the other he pulled out the gold medallion.</p>
      <p id="p_000396" class="indent">He tossed it at the two pirates. It fell into the hole.</p>
      <p id="p_000397" class="indent">"Dig for more of these, you swine!" he said.</p>

        <em id="em_000040">Squawk!</em>
      </p>
      <p id="p_000399" class="indent">"Look!" Annie said.</p>
      <p id="p_000400" class="indent">Polly was back! She was circling above them!</p>
      <p id="p_000401" class="indent">"Go back!" she squawked.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="48" id="p48" />
      <p id="p_000402" class="indent">Stinky and Pinky looked up at the parrot. They scowled.</p>
      <p id="p_000403" class="indent">"Dig!" shouted Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000404" class="indent">"A big storm is comin', Cap'n!" said Pinky.</p>
      <p id="p_000405" class="indent">"Go back!" said Polly.</p>
      <p id="p_000406" class="indent">"The bird's an omen, Cap'n!" shouted Stinky.</p>
      <p id="p_000407" class="indent">"Dig, you dogs!" cried Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000408" class="indent">"Go back!" squawked Polly.</p>
      <p id="p_000409" class="indent">"The bird's warning us!" shouted Pinky. "We've got to get to the ship before it's too late!"</p>
      <p id="p_000410" class="indent">The two pirates threw down their shovels. They started running toward the rowboat.</p>
      <p id="p_000411" class="indent">"Mutineers! Come back!" shouted Cap'n Bones. He dragged Jack and Annie down the beach as he ran after his men. "Stop!"</p>
      <p id="p_000412" class="indent">But the pirates kept running. They got to the rowboat and pushed it into the sea.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="49" id="p49" />
      <p id="p_000413" class="indent">"Wait!" cried Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000414" class="indent">Pinky and Stinky jumped into the boat. They started rowing.</p>
      <p id="p_000415" class="indent">"Wait!" Cap'n Bones let go of Jack and Annie. He ran into the water. "Wait, you dogs!"</p>
      <p id="p_000416" class="indent">He hauled himself into the rowboat.</p>
      <p id="p_000417" class="indent">Then the three pirates disappeared into the spray of the waves.</p>
      <p id="p_000418" class="indent">"Go back!" squawked Polly.</p>
      <p id="p_000419" class="indent">

      </p>
      <p id="p_000420" class="indent">Just then the storm broke over the island. The wind howled. Rain fell in buckets.</p>
      <p id="p_000421" class="indent">"Let's go!" cried Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000422" class="indent">"Wait! I have to get the medallion!" shouted Jack. He ran to the hole dug by the pirates. He looked down in it.</p>
      <p id="p_000423" class="indent">Even in the dreary light, the medallion was shining.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="50" id="p50" />
      <p id="p_000424" class="indent">Big, fat raindrops were falling into the hole, washing away the sand.</p>
      <p id="p_000425" class="indent">Jack saw a patch of wood.</p>
      <p id="p_000426" class="indent">Then the rain cleared away more sand. And Jack saw the top of an old trunk.</p>
      <p id="p_000427" class="indent">He stared. Was it Captain Kidd's treasure chest?</p>
      <p id="p_000428" class="indent">"Hurry, Jack!" cried Annie. She was halfway up the tree house ladder.</p>
      <p id="p_000429" class="indent">"I found it! I found it!" cried Jack. "I found the treasure chest!"</p>
      <p id="p_000430" class="indent">"Forget the treasure chest!" said Annie. "We have to go now! The storm's getting worse!"</p>
      <p id="p_000431" class="indent">Jack kept staring at the chest. Was there gold inside? Silver? Precious gems?</p>
      <p id="p_000432" class="indent">"Come on!" Now Annie was shouting from the tree house window.</p>
      <p id="p_000433" class="indent">But Jack couldn't tear himself away. He</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="51" id="p51" />
      <p id="p_000434">brushed the rest of the muddy sand off the chest.</p>
      <p id="p_000435" class="indent">"Jack, forget the treasure chest!" cried Annie. "Let's go!"</p>
      <p id="p_000436" class="indent">"Go back!" squawked Polly.</p>
      <p id="p_000437" class="indent">Jack looked at the parrot. She was perched on the black rock.</p>
      <div id="imggroup_img_000022">

        <aside epub:type="annotation" id="bookshare_img_000022">While the storm winds grow stronger, Jack kneels down by the uncovered chest. He turns his head to the parrot standing on the rock above.</aside>
      </div>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="52" id="p52" />
      <p id="p_000439" class="indent">He stared into her wise eyes. He thought he knew her--knew her from somewhere else.</p>
      <p id="p_000440" class="indent">"Go back, Jack," she said. She sounded like a person.</p>
      <p id="p_000441" class="indent">Okay. It was definitely time to go.</p>
      <p id="p_000442" class="indent">Jack took one last look at the treasure chest. He clutched the gold medallion. Then he took off, running toward the tree house.</p>
      <p id="p_000443" class="indent">His socks and rain boots were still there. He quickly pulled the boots on. He shoved the socks into his backpack.</p>
      <p id="p_000444" class="indent">The rope ladder was dancing wildly in the wind. Jack grabbed it.</p>
      <p id="p_000445" class="indent">The ladder swayed as Jack climbed. He was tossed this way and that. But he held on tight.</p>
      <p id="p_000446" class="indent">At last he pulled himself into the tree house.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="53" id="p53" />
      <p id="p_000447" class="indent">"Let's go!" he cried.</p>
      <p id="p_000448" class="indent">Annie was already holding the Pennsylvania book. She pointed to the picture of Frog Creek.</p>
      <p id="p_000449" class="indent">"I wish we could go there!" she shouted.</p>
      <p id="p_000450" class="indent">The wind was already blowing hard. But now it blew even harder.</p>
      <p id="p_000451" class="indent">The tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster.</p>
      <p id="p_000452" class="indent">Then everything was still.</p>
      <p id="p_000453" class="indent">Absolutely still.</p>
