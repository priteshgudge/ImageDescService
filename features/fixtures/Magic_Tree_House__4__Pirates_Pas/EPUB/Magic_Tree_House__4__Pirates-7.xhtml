      <p id="p_000288" class="nonindent">The rowboat tossed from side to side. The waves were huge. Salty spray stung Jack's eyes. He felt seasick.</p>
      <p id="p_000289" class="indent">"Hold 'er steady!" shouted Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <p id="p_000290" class="indent">He pointed at the sea. "Or we'll be meat for those evil brutes!"</p>

      <p id="p_000292" class="indent">He shuddered.</p>
      <p id="p_000293" class="indent">Soon the rowboat pulled alongside the ship.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="34" id="p34" />
      <p id="p_000294" class="indent">The air was filled with wild fiddle music and bagpipes playing. And Jack heard jeers, shouts, and ugly laughter.</p>
      <p id="p_000295" class="indent">"Hoist 'em aboard!" Cap'n Bones shouted to his men.</p>
      <p id="p_000296" class="indent">Annie and Jack were hauled onto the deck.</p>

      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="35" id="p35" />
      <p id="p_000299">from side to side. Ropes flapped and snapped in the wild wind.</p>
      <p id="p_000300" class="indent">Everywhere they looked, Jack and Annie saw pirates.</p>
      <p id="p_000301" class="indent">Some were dancing. Some were drinking. Many were fighting. With swords. Or with their fists.</p>

      <p id="p_000302" class="indent">"Lock 'em in my cabin!" Cap'n Bones ordered.</p>
      <p id="p_000303" class="indent">A couple of pirates grabbed Jack and Annie. And threw them in the ship's cabin. Then locked the door.</p>
      <p id="p_000304" class="indent">The air inside the cabin was damp and sour-smelling. A shaft of gray light came through a small round window.</p>
      <p id="p_000305" class="indent">"Oh man," said Jack. "We've got to figure out how to get back to the island."</p>
      <p id="p_000306" class="indent">"So we can get into the tree house and go home," said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000307" class="indent">"Right." Jack suddenly felt tired. How would they ever get out of this mess?</p>
      <p id="p_000308" class="indent">"We better examine the book," he said.</p>
      <p id="p_000309" class="indent">He reached into his pack and pulled out the pirate book.</p>
      <p id="p_000310" class="indent">He flipped through the pages.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="37" id="p37" />
      <p id="p_000311" class="indent">He looked for information to help them.</p>
      <p id="p_000312" class="indent">"Look," he said.</p>
      <p id="p_000313" class="indent">He found a picture of pirates burying a treasure chest. "This might help."</p>
      <p id="p_000314" class="indent">Together they read the words under the picture.</p>

      <p id="p_000325" class="indent">"Guess what I see?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000326" class="indent">"What?" Jack asked. He looked back at the book.</p>
      <p id="p_000327" class="indent">"A whale."</p>
      <p id="p_000328" class="indent">"Neat," he said. Then he looked up. "A whale? Did you say ... a whale?"</p>
      <p id="p_000329" class="indent">"A whale. A huge whale. As big as a football field."</p>
      <p id="p_000330" class="indent">Jack jumped up and looked out the window with her.</p>

      <p id="p_000336" class="indent">"See the whale's back?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000337" class="indent">"Yep." The slope of the island looked like the back of a whale.</p>
      <p id="p_000338" class="indent">"See his spout?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000339" class="indent">"Yep." The palm tree that held the tree house looked like the spout of the whale.</p>
      <p id="p_000340" class="indent">"See his eye?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000341" class="indent">"Yep." A big black rock looked like the eye of the whale.</p>
