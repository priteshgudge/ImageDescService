      <p id="p_000246" class="nonindent">Jack and Annie watched in horror.</p>
      <p id="p_000247" class="indent">The gold-greedy pirates seemed to have lost their minds.</p>
      <p id="p_000248" class="indent">Jack nudged Annie. Together they started to back slowly away from the pirates. Toward the tree house.</p>
      <p id="p_000249" class="indent">"Halt!" Cap'n Bones shouted. He aimed his pistols at them. "Not another step, lubbers!"</p>
      <p id="p_000250" class="indent">Jack and Annie froze.</p>
      <p id="p_000251" class="indent">Cap'n Bones grinned his black-toothed grin. "Tell old Bones where the rest is," he</p>

      <p id="p_000252">growled. "Or prepare to meet thy doom."</p>
      <p id="p_000253" class="indent">"What--what rest?" said Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000254" class="indent">"The rest of the treasure!" roared Cap'n Bones. "I know it's on this island. I have a map!"</p>
      <p id="p_000255" class="indent">He reached into a belt pouch and pulled out a torn piece of paper. He waved it at Jack and Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000256" class="indent">"Is that a treasure map?" asked Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000257" class="indent">"Aye, it's the map telling about Kidd's treasure."</p>

      </p>
      <p id="p_000259" class="indent">"Why don't you read the map?" said Jack.</p>

      </p>
      <p id="p_000264" class="indent">"Those words." Jack pointed at the words at the bottom of the map.</p>
      <p id="p_000265" class="indent">"Well, it means ... " Cap'n Bones' good eye squinted at the writing. He frowned. He coughed. He rubbed his nose.</p>
      <p id="p_000266" class="indent">"Aw, leave him alone," Pinky growled at Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000267" class="indent">"You know he can't read," said Stinky.</p>
      <p id="p_000268" class="indent">"Shut up!" Cap'n Bones roared at his men.</p>
      <p id="p_000269" class="indent">"Jack and I can read," Annie piped up.</p>
      <p id="p_000270" class="indent">"Shhh," said Jack.</p>
      <p id="p_000271" class="indent">"Cap'n, make 'em read the map!" said Stinky.</p>
      <p id="p_000272" class="indent">Cap'n Bones gave Jack and Annie a dark look. "Read it," he growled.</p>
      <p id="p_000273" class="indent">"Then will you let us go?" said Jack.</p>

        <aside epub:type="annotation" id="bookshare_img_000014">The big pirate holds out the map as Jack points to the words with a finger. The map shows a few islands surrounded by water; two lay in the shape of a whale. On the map is written, "The gold doth lie beneath the whale's eye."</aside>

      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="31" id="p31" />
      <p id="p_000275" class="indent">The pirate squinted his good eye. "Aye, lubber. When the treasure's in me hands, I'll let you go."</p>

        <span id="span_000053" class="text">"Okay," said Jack. "I'll read it to you." He looked at the map. "It says,</span>

      <p id="p_000277" class="indent">"Heh?" Cap'n Bones scowled. "What's that supposed to mean, lubber?"</p>
      <p id="p_000278" class="indent">Jack shrugged.</p>
      <p id="p_000279" class="indent">"Hang it! Take 'em hack to the ship!" shouted Cap'n Bones. "They can rot there till they're ready to tell us how to find Kidd's treasure!"</p>
      <p id="p_000280" class="indent">Jack and Annie were tossed into the rowboat.</p>
      <p id="p_000281" class="indent">Waves splashed the sides. The sky ahead was dark with thunderclouds. A strong wind had started to blow.</p>
      <p id="p_000282" class="indent">"Row, dogs, row!" said Cap'n Bones.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="32" id="p32" />
      <p id="p_000283" class="indent">Pinky and Stinky began rowing toward the big ship.</p>
      <p id="p_000284" class="indent">"Look!" Annie said to Jack. She pointed to the shore.</p>
      <p id="p_000285" class="indent">Polly the parrot was flying over the sand.</p>
      <p id="p_000286" class="indent">"She wants to help us," whispered Annie.</p>
      <p id="p_000287" class="indent">Polly started to fly out over the waves. But the winds were too strong. She turned around and flew back to the island.</p>
