This image description editing web application is intended to be run as a Ruby on Rails application.


The following environment variables need to be set for the application to function as intended:

RACK_ENV {should be set to production (most likely) or development for dev purposes}
POET_HOST {Name of the host of your web application, example: www.myapp.com }

The repository of DAISY book files can be stored in the local file system or Amazon S3. For Amazon S3:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     {AWS Access Key}
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY {AWS Secret Access Key}
POET_ASSET_BUCKET     {Name of the bucket in S3 where you want to store your files}
POET_S3_EXPIRE_DAYS   {Number of days after which you want to expire your S3 files (to save money)}

If you wish, instead, to use a local file system:
POET_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR {fully qualified name of directory. *Make Sure* your application has permissions to this dir}


The application uses Sendgrid by default to send user registration emails. If you wish to use Sendgrid, you will also need to set
the following environment variables:
SENDGRID_USERNAME     {Sendgrid username}
SENDGRID_PASSWORD     {Sendgrid password}

To setup the MySQL database, modify config/database.yml and add the proper connection info for whatever environments will be used. Then run 'rake db:migrate' to create the necessary tables.


After downloading the source code and setting the environment variables, you should run the application using:
"foreman start"
