<b>Example:</b>
 Figure one is a scatter plot titled “Rainfall and Plant Growth,” and shows Plant tissue production (g/m2) over Average Rainfall (mm/year). The plot shows about 85 data points, with the majority of points concentrated in the lower left corner where Plant tissue production and Average Rainfall are lowest, and become less concentrated toward the upper right corner.
<p>
<br>
<b>Guidelines:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Provide type of data display, title, axis labels, units of measurement. </li>
	<li>Describe general changes in concentration of data points.</li>
	<li>Convert data into a table with row and column headings if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Template:</b>
 Figure [#] is a scatter plot titled [title], and shows [y-axis] in [units] over [x-axis] in [units]. Describe changes in concentration.
