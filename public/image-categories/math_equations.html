<b>Guidelines: </b>
<ul>
   <li>The preferred method for describing math is to use the Math Editor. This renders the math in an unambiguous form, known as MathML, which can be translated into a variety of speech styles by various reading devices.</li>
   <li>When MathML is not used and equations must be read aloud, a prose description of the math equation should be provided instead through the Text Editor tool.</li>
   <li>The Text Editor mode will be the default input mode for math.</li>
   <li>Math content should only be provided as text OR math, not both (don't support prose AND MathML input for the same equation/image)</li>
</ul>
